Awesome. Iâ€™ll review and test.

And this would affect the home page as well?

I usually add a featured image to the post, set the post as featured but always selects the no featured image post template.

In other words; I want the thumbnail to show on the home page but not on the post itself.

If you only want thumbnails in the featured posts on the homepage, replace this section in /partials/featured.hbs with the code above instead of /partials/content.hbs.

@minimaluminium Unfortunately, that did not work. I have a local setup whereof the " Start here for a quick overview of everything you need to know" post is assigned to the getting-started tag. I edited that tag by uploading a featured image to it.

The post itself is set as featured by default. I restarted Ghost and refreshed the page. No change. Should I be doing something different or did I miss a step?

@thebear.dev Whoops, sorry about that! You have to include tags in the {{#get}} helper here.

{{#get "posts" filter="featured:true" limit="all" include="tags" as |featured|}}
Also small updates (like class names, and image sizes) for the replacement code:

{{#if primary_tag.feature_image}}
    <div class="u-placeholder horizontal">
        <img class="lazyload u-object-fit"
            data-srcset="{{img_url primary_tag.feature_image size="s"}} 400w, {{img_url primary_tag.feature_image size="m"}} 750w, {{img_url primary_tag.feature_image size="l"}} 960w, {{img_url primary_tag.feature_image size="xl"}} 1140w"
            data-sizes="auto" src="{{img_url primary_tag.feature_image size="m"}}"
            srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
            alt="{{title}}">
    </div>
{{/if}}
